        <h1>Simplex method</h1><br>
        <p>Linear programming involves maximising or minimising a linear objective function subject to a set of linear
            constraints. The simplex method starts with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improves it until
            an optimal solution is found.</p>
        <p>Here are the basic steps of the simplex method:</p>

        <p>1. Formulate the linear programming problem: Define the objective function to be maximised or minimised,
            along with the constraints on the decision variables.</p>
        <p>2. Convert the problem into standard form: Express the problem in the form of equalities by introducing slack
            or surplus variables as necessary.</p>
        <p>3. Set up the initial simplex tableau: Create a table with the coefficients of the variables and constraints.
            This tableau represents the initial feasible solution.</p>
        <p>4. Identify the pivot column: Select the most negative coefficient in the objective row as the entering
            variable.</p>
        <p>5. Identify the pivot row: Determine the pivot row by selecting the smallest nonnegative ratio of the
            constant term to the corresponding coefficient in the pivot column.</p>
        <p>6. Perform the pivot operation: Use elementary row operations to make the pivot element 1 and the other
            elements in the pivot column 0.</p>
        <p>7. Update the tableau: Recalculate the coefficients in the tableau based on the pivot operation.</p>
        <p>8. Repeat steps 4 to 7 until an optimal solution is reached: If there are still negative coefficients in the
            objective row, go back to step 4 and continue. Otherwise, the current solution is optimal, and the algorithm
            terminates.</p>
        <p>9. Read the optimal solution: The optimal solution can be read from the final tableau. The decision variables
            correspond to the basic variables with nonzero values in the rightmost column.</p>

        <p>The simplex method efficiently explores the feasible region by moving from one vertex to another along the
            edges until the optimal solution is reached. However, in some cases, the algorithm may encounter degeneracy
            or cycling, which can prolong the convergence or lead to an infinite loop. Various techniques have been
            developed to handle these issues, such as the Bland's rule and anti-cycling rules.</p>

        <p>It's worth noting that the simplex method is more suitable for medium-sized problems, as its computational
            complexity can become impractical for very large-scale linear programming problems. For such cases, other
            algorithms like interior point methods may be more efficient.</p>

        <h1>Revised Simplex Method</h1><br>

        <p>The Revised Simplex Method is an improved version of the Simplex Method for solving linear programming
            problems. It is based on the same principles as the Simplex Method but incorporates some modifications to
            enhance efficiency and reduce computational effort.</p>

        <p>The Revised Simplex Method is particularly useful when there are only a few variables that are not at their
            bounds (nonbasic variables), as it takes advantage of this sparsity to optimise the algorithm's performance.
            Here are the key steps involved in the Revised Simplex Method:</p>

        <p>1. Formulate the linear programming problem: Define the objective function to be maximised or minimised,
            along with the constraints on the decision variables.</p>
        <p>2. Convert the problem into standard form: Express the problem in the form of equalities by introducing slack
            or surplus variables as necessary.</p>
        <p>3. Set up the initial tableau: Create a table with the coefficients of the variables and constraints. This
            tableau represents the initial feasible solution.</p>
        <p>4. Determine the initial basic variables: Select a set of variables that form an initial feasible solution by
            setting them to their lower or upper bounds and the remaining variables to zero.</p>
        <p>5. Compute the initial basic feasible solution: Use the selected basic variables to calculate the values of
            the remaining nonbasic variables.</p>
        <p>6. Calculate the reduced costs: Compute the reduced costs for the nonbasic variables using the current basic
            feasible solution.</p>
        <p>7. Check for optimality: If all reduced costs are nonnegative, the current solution is optimal, and the
            algorithm terminates. Otherwise, continue to the next step.</p>
        <p>8. Choose the entering variable: Select the nonbasic variable with the most negative reduced cost as the
            entering variable.</p>
        <p>9. Determine the leaving variable: Determine the leaving variable by performing a ratio test on the
            constraints involving the entering variable.</p>
        <p>10. Update the tableau: Use elementary row operations to make the pivot element 1 and the other elements in
            the pivot column 0.</p>
        <p>11. Update the basic feasible solution: Recalculate the values of the basic variables using the pivot
            operation.</p>
        <p>12. Repeat steps 6 to 11 until an optimal solution is reached or the problem is determined to be infeasible
            or unbounded.</p>

        <p>The main difference between the Simplex Method and the Revised Simplex Method is that the Revised Simplex
            Method avoids unnecessary calculations for nonbasic variables that remain at their bounds. Instead of
            recomputing the entire tableau in each iteration, it directly updates the relevant parts of the tableau
            based on the changes in the basic variables. This reduces the computational effort and enhances the
            algorithm's efficiency, especially when there are only a few nonbasic variables that are not at their
            bounds.This can lead to significant computational savings, especially for problems with a large number of
            variables.</p>

        <p>The Revised Simplex Method is particularly useful when there is a sparsity pattern in the problem, meaning
            that only a few variables change in each iteration. It takes advantage of this sparsity to optimise the
            algorithm's performance.</p>

        <p>By following the steps of the Revised Simplex Method, you can efficiently solve linear programming problems
            and find optimal solutions.</p>
