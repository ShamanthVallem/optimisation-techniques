# optimisation-techniques

This is Web portal to calculate max/min of any objective function using linear programming methods.

Inputs:
1) Provide type of problem(maximization or minization) and total number of constraints(inequality + non-negative constraints)
2) Provide number of inequality constraints and click on next
3) Next, Add the coefficients of objective function
4) Add coefficients of all inequality constraints along with constants
5) Choose a method(only simplex is available as of now, but more methods will be added soon)
6) Hola! All the info needed along with all BFS, max/min(objective function) and values of x1, x2, x3, ..... will be calculated.
